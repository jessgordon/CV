I’m a Full Stack Junior Developer, having recently completed a highly selective, intensive 16-week coding Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

I have unashamedly fallen for code in the past year - I’ve found a tool with endless possibilities where I can utilise some of my strongest skills; problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, empathy, and teamwork. The constant evolution of technology, its opportunities to collaborate with others from different backgrounds, and its potential to help solve the smallest to some of the largest problems we currently face is just wildly cool!

## Skills

#### Creative Problem Solver

I like to think creatively and see the potential for a simpler, more accurate or quicker way to do things. I successfully initiated and completed two service improvements whilst working for the local government - these projects resulted in saved time, decreased the risk of human error, and improved functionality. 

Resolving blockers excite and energise me - when something has not worked as it should within team projects, I’ve jumped at the opportunity to analyze the symptoms, identify what’s wrong and find a solution. It’s in these moments I’ve valued Maker’s EQ curriculum, having learnt the art of knowing when to step away, make a cup of tea and regain perspective!

#### Quick Learner

Historically, management has noticed I tend to pick up new tasks quickly. As such, I have been asked to temporarily take on work from other service areas when required. For our final project at Makers, I thrived off of the challenge of learning a new framework along with using new data structures (tries) all within a tight timeframe.

#### Motivated

I strive for excellence, both academically (gained a First Class Honours Degree in Midwifery studies) and in work (promotion to senior within one year of working in local government). Within one week of finishing the Makers Bootcamp, I have signed up for my first hackathon alongside other tech events, and have plans to begin developing my InvestTheRest app alongside completing an algorithmic complexity course. 

#### Communication

I am malleable in my communication style due to my empathetic nature; from respectfully discussing highly sensitive and confidential information with various public sector professionals and residents, to keeping training for new starters fun, inclusive and light-hearted. I passionately believe that sharing knowledge is sharing power. I’ve made myself available to train colleagues in my previous areas of work, and more recently became a mentor for a developer who has just begun their journey at Makers.

#### Teamwork

In my previous role, teamwork skills were essential to ensure SLAs were met and motivations remained high in an emotionally heavy environment. Over two hundred hours of pair programming and three team projects later, I’ve learnt the importance of quiet consideration too - such as maintaining clean code for the ease of other developers.

#### Critical Thinker

My favourite part of my degree was my dissertation - I love to pick apart ideas and evidence, considering their value. Developers I’ve partnered with have noticed that I tend to quickly spot when we are coding our way onto an erroneous path.

## Hobbies

Chuck me a pen, paintbrush, polymer clay, anything crafty along with a pair of headphones and a Spotify subscription and I'll be sorted. I do also go outside and love visiting new places. I've spent six months completing voluntary work in Cusco, Peru. Coming back home to a new episode of ‘never too small’ is perfection (architects reimaging small space living).
