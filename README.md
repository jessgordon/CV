## Jessica Gordon

Studying at Makers Academy where I'm learning to become a full stack Ruby developer.

Since graduating from King’s College London in 2016 with a First Class Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Midwifery studies, I have spent time as a technical support officer for the local government and as an administrator for a community based project in Brixton. Motivation for these roles have been high, as I’ve enjoyed supporting public health and wellbeing. Yet, I knew this quirky square peg mind of mine could find its quadrilateral companion out there somewhere, rather than continuing to try and fit into a round hole that was built for someone else’s working style.

So for the past few years, I’ve tasted every coffee from every local cafe whilst reading career books, taking personality questionnaires, talking with work coaches and questioning friends and colleagues in different sectors (admittedly my kitchen has been the main cafe since the pandemic, coffee wise - not the best, not the worst). A while into this hunt, I had a conversation with a graphic designer who recommended I look into learning basic code as an additional skill - and that is when, finally, I felt I had landed. 

As soon as I wrote my first "Hello, World!" I knew I had discovered something more than a skill to put on my CV. I had discovered a tool with endless possibilities, that energised and excited me. As I completed Harvard’s ‘CS50 Introduction to Computer Science’ course, I was able to utilise some of my strongest skills; problem solving, creative and critical thinking, and could see how my empathy, teamwork and strong communication skills could come into play once working in the industry. It doesn’t fall too far from the public health tree either; tech is one aspect of our existence that currently has the potential to improve or adversely affect our quality of life and future substantially. The constant evolution of technology, its opportunities to collaborate with others from different backgrounds, and its potential to help solve some of the largest problems we currently face makes me want to get involved. I found my square hole!

## What am I hoping for? 
I’d like to be challenged, intellectually stimulated and have chances to be creative. Looking further ahead when I've become well versed in a particular area, I'd be very open to further education/ research (yeah I know, unashamedly geeky - libraries are a happy place for me) and would love to have opportunities to grow my leadership skills.
