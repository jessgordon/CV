I’m a Full Stack Junior Developer, having recently completed a highly selective, intensive 16-week coding Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/). I’d like to be challenged, to be constantly learning and have chances to be creative.

I have unashamedly fallen for code in the past year - I’ve found a tool with endless possibilities where I can utilise some of my strongest skills; problem-solving, creative and critical thinking, empathy, and teamwork. Plus, the constant evolution of technology, its opportunities to collaborate with others from different backgrounds, and its potential to help solve the smallest to some of the largest problems we currently face is just wildly cool! How could I not pursue that!?

## Skills

#### Creative Problem Solver
I like to think creatively and see the potential for a simpler, more accurate or quicker way to do things. I successfully initiated and completed two service improvements whilst working for the local government - these projects resulted in saved time, decreased the risk of human error, and improved functionality. This trait of mine has recently transitioned into a determination to figure out solutions when planning and debugging. It’s in these moments I’ve learnt the art of stepping away and making a cup of tea to regain perspective!

#### Critical Thinker

My favourite part of my degree was my dissertation - I love to pick apart ideas and evidence, considering their value. Devs I’ve partnered with have noticed that I tend to quickly spot when we are coding our way onto an erroneous path, which I put down to my critical thinking.

#### Teamwork

In my previous role, teamwork skills were essential to support and train staff whilst keeping motivation high in an emotionally heavy environment. Over two hundred hours of pair programming and three team projects later, I’ve learnt the importance of quiet consideration too - such as maintaining clean code for the sake of readability and changeability. 

#### Quick Learner

Management has noticed I tend to pick up new tasks quickly, and I have been asked to temporarily take on work from other service areas when required. For our final project at Makers, our team intentionally picked up a new framework none of us had used before to build our web app and succeeded.

#### Motivated

It’s been satisfying to see how my self-led learning has benefited others, such as being able to suggest researching tries for our final project data structure on the first day of planning (thanks to CS50!). I am proud of what we’ve produced in our projects, and have loved working in teams whom all strive to deliver the best.

#### Communication

Whilst working within the local government, high-quality customer care skills were essential. As part of my role, I would phone and email residents, healthcare professionals, police, schools and other service providers regarding highly confidential and sensitive information. When pair programming I regularly check in with my partner, not only to prevent disjointed code but also to acknowledge our needs that day.

## Hobbies

Chuck me a pen, paintbrush, polymer clay, anything crafty along with a pair of headphones and a Spotify subscription and I'll be sorted.\
I do also go outside and love visiting new places. I've spent six months completing voluntary work in Cusco, Peru. Closer to home I'll happily enjoy some live music with friends, go on long walks with a flask of tea, or just lose myself in a charity shop crawl. Coming back home to a new episode of NEVER TOO SMALL is perfection (it’s about reimaging small space living before you ask…).
