## Jessica Gordon

Studying at Makers Academy where I'm learning to become a full stack Ruby developer.

Since graduating from King’s College London in 2016 with a First Class Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Midwifery studies, I have spent time as a technical support officer for the local government and as an administrator for a community based project in Brixton. Motivation for these roles have been high, as I’ve enjoyed supporting public health and wellbeing. Yet, I knew this quirky square peg mind of mine could find its quadrilateral companion out there somewhere, rather than continuing to try and fit into a round hole that was built for someone else’s working style.

It was on this career hunt that I discovered my love for code. As soon as I wrote my first "Hello, World!" I knew I had discovered something more than a skill to put on my CV. I had discovered a tool with endless possibilities, that energised and excited me. I chose to look into tech further, and took Harvard’s ‘CS50 Introduction to Computer Science’ course. On this course, I was able to utilise some of my strongest skills; problem solving, creative and critical thinking, and could see how my empathy, teamwork and strong communication skills could come into play once working in the industry. It doesn’t fall too far from the public health tree either; tech is one aspect of our existence that currently has the potential to improve or adversely affect our quality of life and future substantially. The constant evolution of technology, its opportunities to collaborate with others from different backgrounds, and its potential to help solve some of the largest problems we currently face makes me want to get involved. I found my square hole!

## What am I looking for? 
I’d like to be challenged, intellectually stimulated and have chances to be creative. Looking further ahead when I've become well versed in a particular area, I'd be very open to further education/ research (yeah I know, unashamedly geeky - libraries are a happy place for me) and would love to have opportunities to grow my leadership skills.

## Skills

#### Creative Problem Solver
I like to think creatively and see potential - I'm eager to make things more efficient when I realise that there is a simpler, more accurate or quicker way to do things. For example, I successfully initiated and completed two service improvements within my technical support team whilst working for the local government. These projects resulted in saved time, decreased the risk of human error, and improved functionality. This trait of mine has given me much joy when I get to refactor code!

#### Critical Thinker

My favourite part of my BSc Degree was researching and writing up my dissertation. I love to pick apart ideas and evidence, get really involved in a particular area, and then present a balanced argument. Basically, I love learning (ahem geek hint no. 2)! 

#### Teamwork

I've trained new starters and two managers who joined our technical support team whilst working for the local government, to ensure the smooth running of our services whilst our team went through a period of a lot of change. In this role, I collaborated with other teams and management to ensure SLAs were met and issues were escalated in a timely manner. As management noticed I tend to pick up new tasks quickly, I have supported other teams when required, such as spending six months in another service area. A benefit to working for the local government meant I was also able to volunteer to complete food shop and drops for vulnerable residents whilst in lockdown through our council.

#### Communication Skills

Whilst working within the local government, high quality customer care skills were essential. As part of my role I would phone and email residents, healthcare professionals, police, schools and other service providers regarding highly confidential and sensitive information. Communication with clients and other healthcare professionals was also at the centre of safe care whilst working in maternity, I was continually assessed on these skills throughout my three years of training.
